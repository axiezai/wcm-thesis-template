\section{Citing and Referencing}
  One thing was certain, that the WHITE kitten had had nothing to
do with it:---it was the black kitten's fault entirely \cite{aiw}.  For the
white kitten had been having its face washed by the old cat for
the last quarter of an hour (and bearing it pretty well,
considering); so you see that it COULDN'T have had any hand in
the mischief.

If you want to refer to something you labeled, you can say in Chapter \ref{chap:intro}, we showed a figure of a GitHub logo (see Figure \ref{fig:octocat}).
